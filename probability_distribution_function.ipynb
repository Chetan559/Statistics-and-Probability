    "- Moving in the **Y-direction** for each point and moving perpendicularly upwards, we collect all possible Gaussian curves that intersect at specific points.  \n",
    "  Then, **we sum up the Y-density for all intersecting Gaussian curves at those points**.  \n",
    "  This sum represents the density for each particular data point.\n",
    "- Similarly, for all data points along the x-axis, we count the number of Gaussian curves intersecting each data point and sum up all the Y-density values.  \n",

    "### Bandwidth\n",
    "\n",
    "In KDE, the **standard deviation is known as the ‘Bandwidth’**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bandwidth acts like a **‘Hyperparameter’** that we can adjust based on our needs.\n",
    "- If we **decrease the bandwidth**, we reduce the spread of the normal distribution.  \n",
    "  Consequently, the **‘peakiness’ of the normal distribution increases**, leading to spikes in the overall curve when we sum up all the Y-density points.\n",
    "- Conversely, **increasing the bandwidth spreads out the normal distribution**, causing data points to scatter more widely.\n",
    "- As a result, the **Y-density decreases**, reducing peakiness and producing a **smoother overall curve**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, for each data point, we determine a **‘kernel’**, and then we calculate the overall **Y-value** by summing the Y-points of all intersecting Gaussian kernels at a given **X-value** and plot the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, another crucial factor is the **‘Bandwidth’ or Standard Deviation**:\n",

    "- Increasing bandwidth → **wider Gaussian kernel → smoother overall curve**\n",
