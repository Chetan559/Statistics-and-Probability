    "### Establishing Causation\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove causation, you typically need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal precedence**: Cause must come before effect\n",
    "2. **Correlation**: Variables must be related\n",
    "3. **No alternative explanations**: Rule out confounding variables\n",
    "4. **Experimental evidence**: Randomized controlled trials showing manipulation of one variable changes the other\n",
    "5. **Mechanism**: Logical explanation for how one variable causes the other\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always question: \"Could there be another explanation for this relationship?\"\n",
    "- Use phrases like \"associated with\" or \"related to\" rather than \"causes\" when only correlation exists\n",
    "- Be skeptical of claims that jump from correlation to causation without proper evidence\n",
    "- Design experiments (not just observe) to test causal relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "note: Most data analysis reveals correlations. Proving causation requires careful experimental design, control of confounding variables, and often longitudinal studies or randomized controlled trials."

    "## Visualizing Multiple Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "definition: Techniques to display relationships between three or more variables simultaneously in a single plot, allowing us to understand complex interactions and patterns in multivariate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Visualize Multiple Variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how variables interact together (not just pairwise)\n",
    "- Identify patterns that emerge only when considering multiple dimensions\n",
    "- Compare groups across multiple metrics simultaneously\n",
    "- Reduce the need for multiple separate plots\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Techniques for Multiple Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Adding a Third Variable to 2D Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Color/Hue Encoding**\n",
    "- Use color to represent a third categorical variable\n",
    "- Example: Scatterplot of height vs weight, colored by gender\n",
    "- Works well with: Scatterplots, line plots, bar plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Size Encoding (Bubble Chart)**\n",
    "- Use bubble size to represent a third numerical variable\n",
    "- Example: Scatterplot of GDP vs life expectancy, bubble size = population\n",
    "- Also called: Bubble plot\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Shape/Marker Encoding**\n",
    "- Use different shapes for a third categorical variable\n",
    "- Example: Scatterplot with circles for male, triangles for female\n",
    "- Limit: Best with 3-5 categories maximum\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Faceting/Small Multiples**\n",
    "- Create separate subplots for each category of a third variable\n",
    "- Also called: FacetGrid, subplot grid\n",
    "- Example: Separate scatterplots for each country showing same relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Specialized Multi-Variable Plots**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Pairplot (Scatterplot Matrix)**\n",
    "- Grid showing all pairwise relationships between multiple numerical variables\n",
    "- Diagonal shows distributions of individual variables\n",
    "- Off-diagonal shows scatterplots between pairs\n",
    "- Can add color for categorical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Heatmap with Hierarchical Clustering**\n",
    "- Shows correlation matrix for multiple variables\n",
    "- Color intensity represents correlation strength\n",
    "- Can add dendrograms to group similar variables (ClusterMap)\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Parallel Coordinates Plot**\n",
    "- Each vertical axis represents one variable\n",
    "- Each line connects values for one observation across all variables\n",
    "- Good for: Comparing patterns across many variables, identifying clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. 3D Scatterplot**\n",
    "- Uses x, y, z axes for three numerical variables\n",
    "- Can add color/size for fourth and fifth variables\n",
    "- Limitation: Hard to interpret, rotation needed, avoid if possible\n",
    "\n",
    "**e. Contour Plot / Heatmap (2D)**\n",
    "- Shows relationship between three numerical variables\n",
    "- x and y axes for two variables, color/contour lines for third\n",
    "- Good for: Visualizing surfaces, density, or model predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Advanced Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Violin Plot (grouped)**\n",
    "- Shows distribution of numerical variable across multiple categories\n",
    "- Can be split by another categorical variable\n",
    "- Combines box plot + KDE for rich information\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Stacked/Grouped Bar Charts**\n",
    "- Compare multiple categories across groups\n",
    "- Stacked: Shows composition and total\n",
    "- Grouped: Shows side-by-side comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Bubble Chart with Multiple Encodings**\n",
    "- x-axis: numerical variable 1\n",
    "- y-axis: numerical variable 2\n",
    "- Size: numerical variable 3\n",
    "- Color: categorical or numerical variable 4\n",
    "- Can represent 4-5 variables in one plot\n",
    "\n",
    "**d. Animated Plots**\n",
    "- Use time as an additional dimension\n",
    "- Show how relationships change over time\n",
    "- Example: Gapminder plots showing development over decades\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dos:**\n",
    "- Limit to 3-4 variables maximum for clarity\n",
    "- Use color-blind friendly palettes\n",
    "- Add legends and clear labels\n",
    "- Choose encoding that matches variable type (categorical vs numerical)\n",
    "- Use faceting when patterns differ significantly across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don'ts:**\n",
    "- Avoid 3D plots unless absolutely necessary (2D + color is usually better)\n",
    "- Don't use too many colors (max 7-10 categories)\n",
    "- Don't combine too many encoding methods (overwhelming)\n",
    "- Avoid pie charts for multiple variables (use stacked bars instead)\n",
    "\n",

    "### Choosing the Right Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variables | Best Plot | Alternative |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| 2 numerical + 1 categorical | Scatterplot with color | Faceted scatterplot |\n",
    "| 3 numerical | Scatterplot with size/color | 3D scatterplot (avoid) |\n",
    "| 1 numerical + 2 categorical | Grouped/stacked bar chart | Faceted bar plot |\n",
    "| Multiple numerical pairs | Pairplot | Correlation heatmap |\n",
    "| Many numerical variables | Parallel coordinates | Multiple scatterplots |\n",
    "| Time + 2 numerical | Line plot with multiple lines | Animated scatterplot |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business**: Sales vs Marketing Spend, colored by Region, sized by Profit\n",
    "2. **Health**: Weight vs Height, colored by Gender, faceted by Age Group\n",
    "3. **Finance**: Stock Returns vs Volatility, colored by Sector, sized by Market Cap\n",
    "4. **Science**: Temperature vs Pressure vs Volume (contour plot)\n",
    "5. **Social**: Income vs Education, colored by Occupation, faceted by City\n",
    "\n",
    "note: The goal is insight, not complexity. If a visualization is hard to understand, simplify or split into multiple simpler plots."
