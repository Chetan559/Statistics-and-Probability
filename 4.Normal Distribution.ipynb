    "## How to use PDF in Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "definition: A Probability Density Function (PDF) describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. The area under the curve between two points gives the probability for that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "key concept: PDF height shows relative likelihood. Higher PDF = more likely values in that region. Total area under curve = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Understanding Data Distribution**\n",
    "- Visualize data shape using KDE (Kernel Density Estimation)\n",
    "- Identify if normal, skewed, bimodal, etc.\n",
    "- Example: `sns.kdeplot(data['salary'])` shows salary distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Detecting Outliers**\n",
    "- Low PDF values indicate rare/unusual data points\n",
    "- Useful for fraud detection, anomaly detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- Check if features are normally distributed\n",
    "- Apply transformations (log, sqrt) if skewed\n",
    "- Re-check PDF after transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Model Validation**\n",
    "- Verify model assumptions (e.g., normal residuals in regression)\n",
    "- Compare empirical PDF with theoretical PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Probability Calculations**\n",
    "- Find P(a < X < b) = area under curve from a to b\n",
    "- Calculate percentiles and quantiles\n",
    "- Example: Probability customer spends $50-$100\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Risk Assessment**\n",
    "- Quantify uncertainty in predictions\n",
    "- Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) in finance\n",
    "- Provide probabilistic forecasts instead of point estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common PDFs in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal**: Bell-shaped, symmetric (heights, test scores)\n",
    "- **Log-Normal**: Right-skewed (income, stock prices)\n",
    "- **Exponential**: Time between events (customer arrivals)\n",
    "- **Uniform**: All values equally likely (random generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Workflow\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Visualize PDF\n",
    "sns.kdeplot(data=df['variable'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Identify distribution type\n",
    "# 3. Apply appropriate techniques based on shape\n",
    "# 4. Make data-driven decisions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "note: PDF helps you understand data distribution, validate assumptions, detect outliers, and make probabilistic predictions. Always combine PDF visualization with other statistics for complete insights."

    "## 2D Density Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "definition: A visualization that shows the probability density of two continuous variables simultaneously. It displays where data points are concentrated in 2D space using colors or contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "also known as: Bivariate density plot, 2D KDE plot, density heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extension of 1D PDF to two dimensions\n",
    "- Color intensity or contour lines represent density\n",
    "- Darker/brighter colors = higher concentration of data points\n",
    "- Lighter colors = fewer data points\n",
    "- Smooth representation of data distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of 2D Density Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Contour Plot**\n",
    "- Uses lines (contours) to show regions of equal density\n",
    "- Like elevation lines on a topographic map\n",
    "- Each line represents same density level\n",
    "- Closer lines = steeper density change\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Filled Contour Plot**\n",
    "- Contour plot with colored regions between lines\n",
    "- Easier to see density gradients\n",
    "- Color scale shows density intensity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Heatmap Density Plot**\n",
    "- Smooth color gradient showing density\n",
    "- No distinct contour lines\n",
    "- Most intuitive for quick interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use 2D density plots when:**\n",
    "- You have many overlapping points in scatterplot\n",
    "- Want to see concentration patterns in 2D space\n",
    "- Need to visualize distribution of two continuous variables\n",
    "- Scatterplot is too cluttered (thousands of points)\n",
    "- Identifying clusters or modes in bivariate data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don't use when:**\n",
    "- You have few data points (scatterplot is better)\n",
    "- Variables are categorical\n",
    "- You need to see individual data points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles overplotting (overlapping points) well\n",
    "- Shows density patterns clearly with many data points\n",
    "- Reveals multimodal distributions (multiple peaks)\n",
    "- Smooth, professional appearance\n",
    "- Reduces visual clutter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loses information about individual points\n",
    "- Requires sufficient data for accurate estimation\n",
    "- Bandwidth selection affects appearance\n",
    "- Can hide outliers\n",
    "- Harder to see exact values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 1: Seaborn KDE plot (smooth density)\n",
    "sns.kdeplot(data=df, x='variable1', y='variable2', fill=True, cmap='Blues')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 2: Hexbin plot (alternative)\n",
    "plt.hexbin(df['variable1'], df['variable2'], gridsize=30, cmap='YlOrRd')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method 3: 2D histogram (discrete bins)\n",
    "plt.hist2d(df['variable1'], df['variable2'], bins=50, cmap='viridis')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single peak**: Unimodal distribution, one main cluster\n",
    "- **Multiple peaks**: Multiple clusters or subgroups\n",
    "- **Elongated shape**: Strong correlation between variables\n",
    "- **Circular shape**: Little to no correlation\n",
    "- **Diagonal pattern**: Positive or negative correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining with Scatterplot\n",
    "\n",
    "Best practice: Overlay density with scatterplot\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.kdeplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', fill=True, alpha=0.5)\n",
    "sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='x', y='y', alpha=0.3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Shows both overall density and individual points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer segmentation (age vs income)\n",
    "- Visualizing correlation with many data points\n",
    "- Geographic data (latitude vs longitude density)\n",
    "- Sensor data analysis (temperature vs pressure)\n",
    "- Bioinformatics (gene expression levels)\n",
    "\n",
    "note: 2D density plots are the 2D equivalent of histograms/KDE plots for 1D data. They're essential when scatterplots become too crowded with data points."
