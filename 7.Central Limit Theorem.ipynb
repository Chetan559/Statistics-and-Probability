    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample means of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution of the variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Assumptions of Making Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Central Limit Theorem holds some assumptions that need to be fulfilled to get normally distributed data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A minimum of 30 or more than that should be the sample size. In the above example, we take 100 sets of sample sizes.\n",
    "2. Distribution should be finite or its variance also should be finite, otherwise, it will not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > Ex:- A bag full of candy (red, green, blue). Distribution of candies should be finite, which means there are a limited number of different types of candies in the bag, like we have red, green, and blue. And if the variance is finite, it means the differences between the candies (or numbers) in the bag are not too extreme or wildly different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The sample that we take should be identical and independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- > Ex:- Identical means each sample of candy should be a true representative of the population or say full bag of candy that we are trying to study.  \n",
    "- > Independent means that the outcome of one sample does not affect the outcome of another sample. In our example, this means that if we pick out a red candy from the bag in one sample, it does not change the probability of picking a blue candy in the next sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population mean is “mu” and variance is “sigma square”, then the normal distribution which we form its mean will be the same and the standard deviation will be sigma square by n ($\\sigma^2 / n$), where ’n’ represents the sample size, which in our example is n = 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we find ‘sample mean’ and ‘standard deviation’, then we can find ‘population mean and population standard deviation’.\n",
