According to the mean, both distributions appear the same, with an average of 40 in both years. However, if we plot the Probability Density Function (PDF) for both years, we can observe differences around the tail. While the mean remains consistent in both graphs, the standard deviation differs, indicating a difference in data spread. In 2008, Sachin exhibited greater consistency, with more values clustered around the mean. This suggests that although Sachin did not achieve a century in 2008, he was more consistent in his performance around the average.  \n",
