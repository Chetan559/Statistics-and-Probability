    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals estimate the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall based on sample data. The choice between the Z-procedure and Student’s t-statistics depends on sample size and knowledge of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Z-procedure is used when:**\n",
    "* The sample size is large (typically $n \\geq 30$).\n",
    "* The population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Student’s t-statistics are used when:**\n",
    "* The sample size is small (typically $n < 30$) or unknown.\n",
    "* The population standard deviation ($\\sigma$) is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-procedure is preferred for large sample sizes with a known population standard deviation, while Student’s t-statistics are used for small sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown. Choosing the appropriate method ensures accurate estimation and valid statistical inference."
