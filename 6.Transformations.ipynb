    "- Transformations are nothing but mathematical transforms where by applying some mathematical operation we can try to convert our distribution into a Normal Distribution.\n",

    "- As we know statistics is the mother field of Machine Learning, and whenever any statistician works on any problem whatever complex problem upon which he is working anywhere he finds normal distribution he becomes happy, now can imagine how important is Normal Distribution.\n",
    "- By looking at the normally distributed data statisticians started feeling that they could solve the problem.\n",
    "- In terms of machine learning, we have some algorithms like “Linear Regression”, and “Logistic Regression” We work assuming that the data we are using is Normally distributed data.\n",
    "- If we do not have normal data we want to make them normal. Some other machine learning algorithms like “Decision Tree”, and “Random Forest” give a dam, which means they don’t get bothered about the distribution type of data.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the age column before transformation also appears to be normally distributed. In the QQ Plot, most of the data points are located above the line, with only a few deviations from the line.\n",
    "- However, the fare column distribution clearly exhibits a right-skewed pattern, indicating the need for a log transformation. Before the transformation, we applied two different algorithms: a linear-based algorithm (Logistic Regression) and a tree-based algorithm (Decision Tree), to assess accuracy. The Logistic Regression model achieved 64% accuracy, while the Decision Tree model achieved 68% accuracy.\n",
    "- Next, we applied a log transformation to both columns using `np.log1p` instead of `np.log` to avoid potential issues with zero values in the dataset. Interestingly, the transformation had a more significant impact on the linear model compared to the tree-based model, as decision trees inherently segment the data.\n",
    "- To validate the transformation’s effectiveness, we conducted a cross-validation with 10 iterations, resulting in a consistent 67% accuracy for the logistic regression model. This outcome confirms that the transformation successfully improved the data distribution.\n",
    "- Upon visualization, we observed that the fare column, which was previously far from a normal distribution, moved closer to normality after transformation. Conversely, the age column, which initially exhibited a satisfactory distribution, performed poorly after transformation. This suggests that transformation may not be necessary when the data distribution is already close to normal.\n"
